# Bevy Replicon Example Backend

A simple TCP backend for running examples, testing backend API and serving as a reference for backend implementation.

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT USE this in a real project. Instead, choose a proper backend from [Messaging backends](../README.md#messaging-backends).

To run an [example](examples) use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -p bevy_replicon_example_backend --example <example name>
```

In all examples, you need to start the server first since connecting via TCP in the Rust standard library is blocking.
You won't have this issue with a real backend.
