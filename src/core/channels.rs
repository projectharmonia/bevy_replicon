/// We can't use only a reliable channel. This is because messages are split into packets based on the
/// MTU and are considered received only if all their packets are received. If any packet is dropped,
/// it gets resent with the same data. However, on the client, we care only about the latest data. For example:
///
/// - Tick 1, position X - received.
/// - Tick 2, position Y - missed.
/// - Tick 3, position Z - received.
///
/// By tick 3, we no longer care about the missing position from tick 2, but it will still be resent.
///
/// We also can't use only an unreliable channel. We could implement a custom acknowledgment system on top of it
/// and resend the latest data if a message is lost. However, partial updates would break the game logic.
/// For example, if a component that references an entity is lost, we can't resend it with the new entity
/// because the client might not have received the entity yet.
///
/// This is why we use a dual-channel approach to send data.
///
/// For everything except mutations, we use a reliable channel. This data can't be outdated and is sent in
/// a single update message for each tick to ensure atomic updates.
///
/// For mutations, we use an unreliable channel. This data can be outdated, so we always send the latest values
/// since the last acknowledgement. Messages also include a minimum required tick and are buffered until an
/// update message for the required tick is received. Mutations are split into packet-size messages to allow
/// applying them partially without waiting for all parts of the message.
///
/// See also [`RepliconChannels`] and [corresponding section](../index.html#eventual-consistency)
/// from the quick start guide.
