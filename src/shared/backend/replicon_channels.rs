/// # Replication channels
///
/// To synchronize the state, we send only changes using Bevy's change detection.
///
/// We can't use only a reliable channel because of how reliability is implemented. Messages are split into packets
/// based on the MTU and are considered received only if all their packets are received. If any packet is dropped,
/// it gets resent with the same data. However, on the client, we care only about the latest data. For example:
///
/// - Tick 1, position X - received.
/// - Tick 2, position Y - missed.
/// - Tick 3, position Z - received.
///
/// By tick 3, we no longer care about the missing position from tick 2, but it will still be resent.
///
/// We also can't use only an unreliable channel. We could implement a custom acknowledgment system on top of it
/// and resend the latest data if a message is lost. However, partial updates would break the game logic.
/// For example, if a component that references an entity is lost, we can't resend it with the new entity
/// because the client might not have received the entity yet.
///
/// This is why we use a dual-channel approach to send data.
///
/// For everything except mutations, we use a reliable channel. This data can't be outdated and is sent in
/// a single update message for each tick to ensure atomic updates.
///
/// For mutations, we use an unreliable channel. This data can be outdated, so we always send the latest values
/// since the last acknowledgment. We also include a minimum required tick - the tick on which the last update
/// message was sent. Messages will be buffered until an update message for this tick is received. Mutations
/// are split into packet-size messages to allow applying them partially without waiting for all parts of the message.
/// We guarantee that all mutations for a single entity arrive won't be split across messages, even if they are larger
/// than the packet size. You can also ensure that mutations for specific entities arrive in sync by using
/// [`SyncRelatedAppExt::sync_related_entities`](crate::server::related_entities::SyncRelatedAppExt::sync_related_entities).
///
/// Server events also have minimum required tick. For details, see the documentation on
/// [`ServerEventAppExt::make_independent`](crate::shared::event::server_event::ServerEventAppExt::make_independent).
