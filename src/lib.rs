/*!
A server-authoritative replication crate for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org).

# Quick start

The library doesn't provide any I/O, so you need to add a
[messaging backend](https://github.com/simgine/bevy_replicon#messaging-backends).
If you want to write an integration yourself, see [`shared::backend`] module.

## Prelude

We provide a [`prelude`] module, which exports most of the typically used traits and types.

## Plugins

Add [`RepliconPlugins`] and plugins for your chosen messaging backend to your app:

```
use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use bevy::app::PluginGroupBuilder;

let mut app = App::new();
app.add_plugins((MinimalPlugins, StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins, MyMessagingPlugins));
# struct MyMessagingPlugins;
# impl PluginGroup for MyMessagingPlugins {
#     fn build(self) -> PluginGroupBuilder {
#         PluginGroupBuilder::start::<Self>()
#     }
# }
```

If you use [`MinimalPlugins`], you need to add [`StatesPlugin`](bevy::state::app::StatesPlugin)
manually. It's included by default with [`DefaultPlugins`].

## Server and client creation

This part is specific to your messaging backend. For `bevy_replicon_renet`,
see [this section](https://docs.rs/bevy_replicon_renet#server-and-client-creation).

On server connected clients represented as entities with [`ConnectedClient`] component.
Their data represented as components, such as [`ConnectedClientStats`]. Users can also attach their
own metadata to them or even replicate these entities back to clients.

These entities are automatically spawned and despawned by the messaging backend. You can
also despawn them yourself to trigger a disconnect or use the [`DisconnectRequest`] message
to disconnect after sending messages.

You can use [`On<Add, ConnectedClient>`] to react to new connections,
or use backend-provided events if you need the disconnect reason.

## States

We provide [`ClientState`] and [`ServerState`], which are Bevy [`States`].
These are managed by your messaging backend, and you can use them to control when your systems run.

For systems that should run continuously while in a specific state, use [`IntoScheduleConfigs::run_if`]
with the [`in_state`] run condition:

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# let mut app = App::new();
app.add_systems(
    Update,
    (
        apply_damage.run_if(in_state(ServerState::Running)), // Runs every frame on the server.
        display_vfx.run_if(in_state(ClientState::Connected)), // Runs every frame on the client.
    ),
);
# fn apply_damage() {}
# fn display_vfx() {}
```

To run systems when entering or exiting a state, use the [`OnEnter`] or [`OnExit`] schedules:

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# let mut app = App::new();
app.add_systems(OnEnter(ClientState::Connecting), display_connection_message) // Runs when the client starts connecting.
    .add_systems(OnExit(ClientState::Connected), show_disconnected_message) // Runs when the client disconnects.
    .add_systems(OnEnter(ServerState::Running), initialize_match); // Runs when the server starts.
# fn display_connection_message() {}
# fn show_disconnected_message() {}
# fn initialize_match() {}
```

You can also use these states with [`DespawnOnExit`] to control the lifetime of entities.

Read more about system patterns in the [Abstracting over configurations](#abstracting-over-configurations)
section.

## Replication

It's a process of exchanging data in order to keep the world in sync. Replicon
provides a high-level API to automate server-authoritative replication.

Replication happens only from server to clients. It's necessary to prevent cheating.
If you need to send information from clients to the server, use
[messages](#network-messages-and-events).

For implementation details see [`ServerChannel`](shared::backend::channels::ServerChannel).

### Tick rate

By default, updates are not sent every frame in order to save bandwidth. Replication runs
in [`ServerSystems::Send`] whenever the [`ServerTick`](server::server_tick::ServerTick) resource
changes and if the state is [`ServerState::Running`].

By default, the tick is incremented in [`FixedPostUpdate`] each time [`FixedMain`](bevy::app::FixedMain)
runs. You can configure how often it runs by inserting [`Time<Fixed>`], which is 64 Hz by default.

```rust
use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;

# let mut app = App::new();
// `Time::from_hz` is implemented only for `Fixed`, so the type is inferred.
app.insert_resource(Time::from_hz(30.0)) // Run 30 times per second.
    .add_plugins((MinimalPlugins, StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
```

You can also configure the schedule via [`ServerPlugin::tick_schedule`].

### Entities

By default no entities are replicated. Add the [`Replicated`] marker
component on the server for entities you want to replicate.

On clients [`Remote`] will be automatically inserted for every entity spawned by replication.

When an entity with the [`Replicated`] component is despawned, clients also receive a despawn.

If you remove the [`Replicated`] component from an entity on the server, replication stops.
No replication messages will be sent, including when the entity is despawned.

Entity IDs differ between clients and server. As a result, clients maps server entities to local entities
on receive. These mappings are stored in the [`ServerEntityMap`](shared::server_entity_map::ServerEntityMap)
resource.

### Components

Components will be replicated only on entities marked for replication with [`Replicated`] component.
By default no components are replicated, you need to define rules for it.

Use [`AppRuleExt::replicate`] to create a replication rule for a single component:

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
app.replicate::<ExampleComponent>();

#[derive(Component, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct ExampleComponent;
```

If your component contains an entity, it cannot be deserialized as is
because entities inside components also need to be mapped. Therefore,
to properly replicate such components, mark fields containing entities with
`#[entities]`. See [`Component::map_entities`] for details.

By default all components are serialized with [`postcard`].
In order to serialize Bevy components you need to enable the `serialize` feature on Bevy.

If your component doesn't implement serde traits or you want to customize the serialization
(for example, quantize, skip some fields or apply compression), you can use
[`AppRuleExt::replicate_as`] or [`AppRuleExt::replicate_with`].

You can also create a rule for multiple components. Use [`AppRuleExt::replicate_bundle`],
or pass a tuple of [`RuleFns`] to [`AppRuleExt::replicate_with`]. The components will only
be replicated if all of them are present on the entity. This also allows you to specialize
serialization and deserialization based on specific entity components.

All functions also have `_filtered` variants that additionally accept archetypal filters,
similar to [`Query`]. They are separate functions because Rust doesn't allow default generics
for functions. For more details, see [`AppRuleExt::replicate_filtered`].

#### Required components

You don't want to replicate all components because not all of them are
necessary to send over the network. Components that can be calculated on the client can
be inserted using Bevy's required components feature.

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
// Replicate only transform and player marker.
app.replicate::<Transform>()
    .replicate::<Player>()
    .add_observer(init_player_mesh);

fn init_player_mesh(
    add: On<Add, Mesh2d>,
    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
    mut players: Query<&mut Mesh2d>,
) {
    let mut mesh = players.get_mut(add.entity).unwrap();
    **mesh = meshes.add(Capsule2d::default());
}

#[derive(Component, Deserialize, Serialize)]
#[require(Mesh2d)]
struct Player;
```

This pairs nicely with server state serialization and keeps saves clean.
You can use [`scene::replicate_into`] to fill [`DynamicWorld`] with replicated entities and their components.
On deserialization all missing required components will be inserted, and initialization
systems will restore the correct game state.

If a component can't be used with the required components due to the inability to insert it
without world access, you can create an observer for a replicated marker and insert the actual
component inside it. However, it's preferred to use required components when possible. For example,
it's better to require a [`Handle<T>`] with a default value that doesn't point to any asset
and initialize it later in a hook or observer. This way you avoid archetype moves in ECS.

#### Mutability

There are two ways to change a component value on an entity: re-inserting it or mutating it.

We use Bevy’s change detection to track and send changes. However, it does not distinguish between modifications
and re-insertions. This is why we simply send the list of changes and decide how to apply them on the client.
By default, this behavior is based on [`Component::Mutability`].

When a component is [`Mutable`](bevy::ecs::component::Mutable), we check whether it already exists on the entity.
If it doesn’t, we insert it. If it does, we mutate it. This means that if you insert a component into an entity
that already has it on the server, the client will treat it as a mutation. As a result, triggers may behave
differently on the client and server. If your game logic relies on this semantic, mark your component as
[`Immutable`](bevy::ecs::component::Immutable). For such components, replication will always be applied via insertion.

A single mutation on the server may result in multiple change detection triggers on a client.
Clients track the last applied tick for each entity and apply a mutation only if the tick for the received data is greater.
However, mutation messages include only the server tick on which the message was sent. This is because it would be too expensive
to include the change tick for each entity. So, if a client does not acknowledge the received message in time, the server
will resend the data (because it might have been lost). Since the tick for this message will be greater, the
client will write the component again, even if it is the same. If your game logic relies on this behavior, you can set
[`write_if_neq`](shared::replication::registry::receive_fns::write_if_neq) as your writing function for
the desired components. See [receive markers](#receive-markers) for more details.

### Removals

In Bevy, a component can be removed either alone or together with its required components. However, there is no way to
distinguish between these two cases, so we don't don't remove required components by default. You can override it using
[receive markers](#receive-markers).

#### Component relations

Some components depend on each other. For example, [`ChildOf`] and [`Children`]. You can enable
replication only for [`ChildOf`] so that [`Children`] will be updated automatically on insertion.
Related entities replicate like any others, so children should also have [`Replicated`].

In other words, replicating [`ChildOf`] allows you to replicate entities relationships.
You can also pair [`ChildOf`] with [`AppRuleExt::replicate_filtered`] to replicate only
part of hierarchy.

You can also ensure that their mutations arrive in sync by using [`SyncRelatedAppExt::sync_related_entities`].

#### Deterministic replication

Up until now, we've covered only authoritative replication (AR), where the server is the source of truth
and continuously sends changes. However, sometimes you may want to send data only once and simulate independently,
relying on determinism. This approach is called deterministic replication (DR).

For example, you might use AR for things like player health, and DR for moving platform positions to reduce
network traffic.

Use [`AppRuleExt::replicate_once`] to replicate only the initial value of a component.
You can configure this per-component within a replication rule using [`AppRuleExt::replicate_with`].

See also [server messages](#from-server-to-client), which are also useful for DR.

## Network messages and events

This replaces RPCs (remote procedure calls) in other engines and,
unlike replication, can be sent both from server to clients and from clients to
server.

### From client to server

To send a message from client to server, you need to register the message
with [`ClientMessageAppExt::add_client_message`] instead of [`App::add_message`].

Messages include [`Channel`] to configure delivery guarantees (reliability and
ordering).

These messages will appear on server as [`FromClient`] wrapper message that
contains sender ID and the message.

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
app.add_client_message::<Ping>(Channel::Ordered)
    .add_systems(
        PreUpdate,
        receive
            .after(ServerSystems::Receive)
            .run_if(in_state(ServerState::Running)),
    )
    .add_systems(
        PostUpdate,
        send.before(ClientSystems::Send).run_if(in_state(ClientState::Connected)),
    );

fn send(mut ping: MessageWriter<Ping>) {
    ping.write(Ping);
}

fn receive(mut pings: MessageReader<FromClient<Ping>>) {
    for ping in pings.read() {
        info!("received ping from client `{}`", ping.client_id);
    }
}

#[derive(Message, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Ping;
```

If a message contains an entity, implement
[`MapEntities`](bevy::ecs::entity::MapEntities) for it and use use
[`ClientMessageAppExt::add_mapped_client_message`] instead.

There is also [`ClientMessageAppExt::add_client_message_with`] to register a message with special serialization and
deserialization functions. This could be used for sending messages that contain [`Box<dyn PartialReflect>`], which
require access to the [`AppTypeRegistry`] resource. Don't forget to validate the contents of every
[`Box<dyn PartialReflect>`] from a client, it could be anything!

Alternatively, you can use events with a similar API. First, you need to register the event
using [`ClientEventAppExt::add_client_event`], and then use [`ClientTriggerExt::client_trigger`].

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
app.add_client_event::<Ping>(Channel::Ordered)
    .add_observer(receive)
    .add_systems(Update, send.run_if(in_state(ClientState::Connected)));

fn send(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.client_trigger(Ping);
}

fn receive(ping: On<FromClient<Ping>>) {
    info!("received ping from client `{}`", ping.client_id);
}
# #[derive(Event, Deserialize, Serialize)]
# struct Ping;
```

For events with entities inside use [`ClientEventAppExt::add_mapped_client_event`].
Similar to messages, serialization can also be customized with [`ClientEventAppExt::add_client_event_with`].

If you need to react to the same message on both the client and the server (for example,
to share logic between client-side prediction and authoritative server processing), use
[`SharedMessageAppExt::add_shared_message`] or
[`SharedEventAppExt::add_shared_event`]. The message is emitted as [`LocalOrRemote<M>`]
on both sides, with the [`Sender`] field indicating its origin.

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
app.add_shared_event::<Attack>(Channel::Ordered)
    .add_observer(on_attack);

fn on_attack(attack: On<LocalOrRemote<Attack>>) {
    info!("attack from `{:?}`", attack.sender);
}

#[derive(Event, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Attack;
```

Similar to regular client messages, we also provide [`SharedEventAppExt::add_mapped_shared_event`].
and [`SharedEventAppExt::add_shared_event_with`].

### From server to client

A similar technique is used to send messages from server to clients. To do this,
register a message with [`ServerMessageAppExt::add_server_message`]
and send it from server using [`ToClients`]. This wrapper contains send parameters
and the message itself.

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
app.add_server_message::<Pong>(Channel::Ordered)
    .add_systems(
        PreUpdate,
        receive
            .after(ClientSystems::Receive)
            .run_if(in_state(ClientState::Connected)),
    )
    .add_systems(
        PostUpdate,
        send.before(ServerSystems::Send).run_if(in_state(ServerState::Running)),
    );

fn send(mut pongs: MessageWriter<ToClients<Pong>>) {
    pongs.write(ToClients {
        targets: SendTargets::All,
        message: Pong,
    });
}

fn receive(mut pongs: MessageReader<Pong>) {
    for pong in pongs.read() {
        info!("received pong from the server");
    }
}

#[derive(Message, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Pong;
```

Just like for client messages, we provide [`ServerMessageAppExt::add_mapped_server_message`]
and [`ServerMessageAppExt::add_server_message_with`].

Event API is available. First, you need to register an event with [`ServerEventAppExt::add_server_event`]
and then use [`ServerTriggerExt::server_trigger`]:

```
# use bevy::{prelude::*, state::app::StatesPlugin};
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins((StatesPlugin, RepliconPlugins));
app.add_server_event::<Pong>(Channel::Ordered)
    .add_observer(receive)
    .add_systems(Update, send.run_if(in_state(ServerState::Running)));

fn send(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.server_trigger(ToClients {
        targets: SendTargets::All,
        message: Pong,
    });
}

fn receive(_on: On<Pong>) {
    info!("received pong from the server");
}
# #[derive(Event, Deserialize, Serialize)]
# struct Pong;
```

And just like for client events, we provide [`ServerEventAppExt::add_mapped_server_event`]
and [`ServerEventAppExt::add_server_event_with`].

We guarantee that clients will never receive events or messages that point to an entity or require specific
component to be presentt which client haven't received yet. For more details see the documentation on
[`ServerMessageAppExt::make_message_independent`].

## Abstracting over configurations

Depending on the game, you may need to support some of these configurations:

- Client
- Dedicated (headless) server
- Listen server (where the server is also a client)
- Singleplayer

There are 2 ways to support multiple configurations at the same time.

### Classic way

Just split client and server logic. Then for listen server and singleplayer run both the server and client,
just don't accept outside connections for singleplayer.

However, you can't simply run both the client and server in a single app for a listen server. Since they operate
on the same world, any changes will trigger replication, which will be sent with a delay and then applied to the
same entities, overriding the latest values and triggering changes again.

- Two Bevy apps inside a single process, running in separate threads.
- Two executables. After starting the client app, the server starts in the background.
- Use [receive markers](#receive-markers) to discard replication on listen server.

It's not easy to set up and requires more resources due to the synchronization between two worlds.
This is why, while it's possible to use Replicon this way, we recommend a different approach.

### The recommended way

Instead of recreating full client-server logic, we provide a way to emulate client and server functionality
without actually running them:

- Client configuration runs only the client and its logic.
- Dedicated server configuration runs only the server and its logic (all client logic usually compiled out).
- Listen server configuration runs only the server and both logics.
- Singleplayer configuration doesn't run the client or server but runs both logics.

To achieve this, use the provided [`ClientState`] and [`ServerState`] states:

- Use [`ClientState::Disconnected`] for systems that require server authority.
  For example, systems that apply damage or send server events. This basically means "run when not a client",
  which applies to both server **and** singleplayer.
- Use [`ClientState::Connecting`], [`ClientState::Connected`], [`ServerState::Running`], etc.
  **only** for miscellaneous things, like display a connection message or a menu to kick connected players
  (things that actually require server or client running)
- For everything else don't use Replicon's states.

Everything else is done automatically by the crate. All provided
[examples](https://github.com/simgine/bevy_replicon/tree/master/example_backend/examples)
use this approach.

Internally we run replication sending system only in [`ServerState::Running`] and replication receiving
only in [`ClientState::Connected`]. This way for singleplayer replication systems won't run at all and
for listen server replication will only be sending (server world is already in the correct state).

For messages, it's a bit trickier. For all client messages, we internally drain messages as `E` and send
them as [`FromClient<E>`] locally with [`ClientId::Server`] in [`ClientState::Disconnected`].
For server messages we drain [`ToClients<E>`] and, if the [`ClientId::Server`] is the recipient of the message,
re-emit it as `E` locally. The same applies to the event API. This emulates message receiving for both server
and singleplayer without actually transmitting data over the network.

We also provide [`ClientSystems`] and [`ServerSystems`] to schedule your system at specific time in the frame.
For example, you can run your systems right after receive using [`ClientSystems::Receive`] or [`ServerSystems::Receive`].

## Organizing your game code

If you support a dedicated server, it's recommended to split your game logic into "client", "server", and "shared"
crates. This way, you can compile out all unnecessary code for the dedicated server configuration.
Alternatively, you can use [Cargo features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) and split
the logic into modules.

We provide `client` and `server` features to disable unneeded functionality for this use case.
You will need to disable similar features on your messaging backend crate too.

<div class="warning">

Make sure that the component, event and message registration order is the same on the client and server. Simply put all
registration code in your "shared" crate.

</div>

If you don't need to support a dedicated server configuration, it's easier to keep the logic grouped together.
Splitting your game into crates is still useful, but it should be done logically rather than on server/client
basis.

## Advanced features

### Authorization

Connected clients are considered authorized when they have the [`AuthorizedClient`] component. Without this
component, clients can only receive events and messages marked as independent via [`ServerMessageAppExt::make_message_independent`]
or [`ServerEventAppExt::make_event_independent`]. Additionally, some components on connected clients are only present
after replication starts. See the required components for [`AuthorizedClient`] for details.

By default, this component is automatically inserted when the client and server [`ProtocolHash`] matches.
This behavior can be customized via [`RepliconSharedPlugin::auth_method`].

### Client visibility

You can control which parts of the world are visible to each authorized client by using components registered as visibility filters.
This works similarly to collision layers in physics: you insert filters to both the client and gameplay entities.
See [`AppVisibilityExt`] for API details.

The server always sees the entire world, even in listen-server mode.

### Prioritization

By default, all unacknowledged mutations are sent every tick. This can be expensive if you
have many entities with mutating components. Priority can be configured globally for an entity
via [`ReplicatePriority`] or per client via the [`PriorityMap`] component on an
[`AuthorizedClient`]. The precedence is per-client [`PriorityMap`], [`ReplicatePriority`],
then the default priority of `1.0`.

This should not be confused with replication rule priority. Rule priority, configured via
[`AppRuleExt::replicate_with_priority`] or [`AppRuleExt::replicate_bundle_with`], only controls
which replication rule is selected. It does not affect mutation send priority.

In addition, [client visibility](#client-visibility) can be used to further reduce bandwidth by hiding entities
that are irrelevant to a given client.

### Interpolation and/or client-side prediction

Due to network round-trip time and [tick rate](#tick-rate), you may notice that the state isn't updated
immediately. This might be fine depending on your type of game. However, sometimes this needs to be visually hidden.

To make value updates look smooth, you can just to interpolate the received state. If the input delay doesn't matter
for your type of game, it can be enough.

But if your game is fast-paced, waiting for server to receive your inputs and replicate the state back might
might be unacceptable. The solution is to predict simulation on the client.

However, it introduces another problem - misspredictions. For example, player 1 might predict movement to point X,
while player 2 might have stunned it, the player 1 just didn't receive it yet. To solve this, client must apply
the received state from server and replay its inputs.

How much to predict also depends on the game. Common approaches are:

- Predict individual entities. Common for shooters or games where you don't have many entities. In the case of
  a misprediction or non-deterministic mismatch, the state will be corrected. Determinism is important for this
  approach to reduce the number of rollbacks.
- Predict the entire world. Common for physics-based games or games with many entities. With this approach,
  all predicted entities are rolled back to the oldest received tick. For example, if one entity have confirmed tick 1
  and another entity have confirmed tick 2, both entities are rolled back to tick 1. This approach is usually more expensive
  but produces better results for physics. Additionally, if there are many predicted entities, it might even be faster
  since there's no need to check each entity for misprediction. The more entities you predict, the more likely it is
  that at least one will trigger a world rollback. So with this approach client usually just always rollbacks.

We don't have these features built-in, but we provide a low-level API to implement these abstractions on top.
Check the [corresponding section](https://github.com/simgine/bevy_replicon#interpolation-andor-rollback)
in our README for existing implementations.

### Predicting spawns

Sometimes it's necessary to spawn an entity on the client before receiving replication from the server.
A common example is projectiles. By default, the client will end up with two entities: one locally spawned
and one replicated from the server.

We provide the [`Signature`] component, which allows replicated entities to be matched with entities
previously spawned on the client.

This is also useful for synchronizing scenes. Both the client and the server can load a level independently
and then match level entities to synchronize certain things, such as opened doors.

#### Receive markers

This is similar to replication rules, except markers are client-specific and only define how components
are applied to entities. This allows you to customize writing based on components that might not be known to the server.
For example, on clients some entities might be predicted, while others might be interpolated, and their values need to be written
differently. The server does not need to know which entities the client interpolates and which it predicts.

[`AppMarkerExt::set_receive_fns<C>`] allows you to override how the component `C` is written by default.
To select a different writing function for a specific entity, you need to register a marker via [`AppMarkerExt::register_marker<M>`]
and associate functions for components with this marker using [`AppMarkerExt::set_marker_fns<M, C>`]. These functions will be called for `C`
if the marker `M` is present. You can also control marker priority or enable processing of old values using
[`AppMarkerExt::register_marker_with<M>`].

It's also possible to override despawns received from the server via
[`ReplicationRegistry::despawn`](shared::replication::registry::ReplicationRegistry::despawn), which is also often used together
with receive markers.

### Replication userdata

It's possible to attach arbitrary bytes to replication messages by writing to the [`ReplicationUserdata`](server::ReplicationUserdata)
resource. When the client receives a replication message containing userdata, [`UserdataReceived`](client::UserdataReceived) is triggered.

### Ticks information

This requires an understanding of how replication works. See the documentation on
[`ServerChannel`](shared::backend::channels::ServerChannel) and [this section](#eventual-consistency) for more details.

To get information about confirmed ticks for individual entities, we provide
[`ConfirmHistory`](client::confirm_history::ConfirmHistory). This component is updated when any replication for its entity is received.
For convenience, we also emit the [`EntityReplicated`](client::confirm_history::EntityReplicated) to ergonomically react on it.

However, an entity might not have any mutations at a given tick. You can check this by inspecting whether all mutate messages have
been received for this tick via [`ServerMutateTicks`](client::server_mutate_ticks::ServerMutateTicks). Since this requires including
the number of mutate messages in each mutate message, you need to enable this by setting [`ServerPlugin::track_mutate_messages`].
For convenience, we also emit the [`MutateTickReceived`](client::server_mutate_ticks::MutateTickReceived) to ergonomically react on it.

So, a tick for an entity is confirmed if one of the following is true:
- [`ConfirmHistory`](client::confirm_history::ConfirmHistory) reports that the tick is received.
- [`ServerMutateTicks`](client::server_mutate_ticks::ServerMutateTicks) reports that for at least one of the next ticks, all update
  messages have been received.

### Optimizing entity serialization

Serialization of [`Entity`] is optimized for use in scenes, but it’s not very efficient for networking. Because of this, we use our own implementation.
See the [`compact_entity`] module if you want to apply this optimization to entities in your own types. You can also use
[`postcard_utils::entity_to_extend_mut`] and [`postcard_utils::entity_from_buf`] for manual writing.

# Eventual consistency

All events, messages, inserts, removals and despawns will be applied to clients in the same order as on the server.

However, if you insert/mutate a component and immediately remove it, the client will only receive the removal because the component value
won't exist in the [`World`] during the replication process. But removal followed by insertion will work as expected since we buffer removals.

Entity component mutations may be applied to clients in a different order than on the server.
For example, if two entities are spawned in tick 1 on the server and their components are mutated in tick 2,
then the client is guaranteed to see the spawns at the same tick, but the component mutations may appear later (but not earlier).

If a component is dependent on other data, mutations to the component will only be applied to the client when that data has arrived.
So if your component references another entity, mutations to that component will only be applied when the referenced entity has been spawned on the client.

Mutations for despawned entities will be discarded automatically, but events, messages or components may reference despawned entities and should be handled with that in mind.

Clients should never assume their world state is the same as the server's on any given tick value-wise.
World state on the client is only "eventually consistent" with the server's.

# Troubleshooting

If you face any issue, try to enable logging to see what is going on.
To enable logging, you can temporarily set `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `bevy_replicon=debug`
(or `bevy_replicon=trace` for more noisy output) like this:

```bash
RUST_LOG=bevy_replicon=debug cargo run
```

You can also filter by specific module like this:

```bash
RUST_LOG=bevy_replicon::shared::protocol=debug cargo run
```

The exact method depends on the OS shell.

Alternatively you can configure `LogPlugin` from Bevy to make it permanent.

For deserialization errors on client we use `error` level which should be visible by default.
But on server we use `debug` for it to avoid flooding server logs with errors caused by clients.
